3. Return type of malloc() function is a void pointer. So what is void pointer ? “use such a function to return a pointer to any data-type. However, you cannot dereference a void* pointer. So, to do anything useful with the return value of a function that returns a void*, you need to first cast it to some pointer type”.
4. That is the reason we type cast malloc a pointer to structure for linked list `struct node *linkNode = (node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));`
